## How to run Wizzyworks
In order to run wizzyworks you will need a couple of things:
- A computer to run the Godot project, The bridge and the server (we hosted the server...).
- A camera in order to read the ArUco marker.
- Preferably, but not neccessary, a monitor or projector to connect the computer to (larger is better). 

## Godot project
- Shoot fireworks with M?
## Bride
## Server
